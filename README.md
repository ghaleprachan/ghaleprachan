Hi, Welcome!
------------

I'm an enthusiastic and energetic mobile application developer with the experience of building, incorporating, and testing mobile applications, with a solid knowledge of programming language, android SDKs, REST API, mobile app development lifecycle, and database.

I enjoy creating things that are live on the internet, whether that be websites, mobile applications or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect and best performance experience to end users. You can visit my [Portfolio Here](https://ghaleprachan.github.io/#/) which is built with flutter.

### Here are some of the technologies that I'm actively working with:

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html#is-anything-missing) 
- [JavaScript](https://javascript.info/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
- [Wear OS With Compose](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables)
