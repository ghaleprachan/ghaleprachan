Hi, Welcome!
------------

I'm an enthusiastic and energetic mobile application developer with the experience of building, incorporating, and testing mobile applications, with a solid knowledge of programming language, android SDKs, REST API, mobile app development lifecycle, database, and little bit of backend development.

I enjoy creating things that are live on the internet, whether that be websites, mobile applications or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect and best performance experience to end users. You can visit my [Portfolio Here](https://ghaleprachan.github.io/#/) which is completely built with flutter.

Recently, my interest towards blockchain technology has increased a lot. I have been reading many blogs and research done on this technology. 

### Here are some of the technologies that I'm actively working with:
